# Internetworking-Protocol
This is a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) application.
It provides a generic message passing framework for multiple clients to communicate with each other via a central forwarding server.

This document describes in detail about the services available to the client. An IRC application user can create rooms, join rooms - which are groups of users that are subscribed to the same message stream. Any message sent to that room is forwarded to all users currently joined to that room. In addition to that users can leave the room and list the rooms that the user wants to join and can view all the members in a room. Users who want to exit the application will be disconnected from the server and respective rooms joined.
